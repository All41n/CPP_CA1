For this assignment, you are required to develop acontainerlibrary application to store items of your choice, for example, movies, books, CDs, films, football players, actors, etc. Each item in the library must contain at least four properties. 
For example, a book might include Title, ISBN, Author, description and genre. Your application must provide the following basic functionality:
- Add items to the library
- Remove items from the library
- Edit any property of an item in the library
- Search for items in the library. This must allowthe user to search by at least two of the properties of the item you have defined. For example, you should be able to search for books by both title and author.
- Sort items in the library by any of the itemsâ€™ properties.When the applicationfirst loads, the library should be loaded from a text file. At least two test files must be provided as part of the final submission. When items are changed (Added, Removed or Edited) the text file should be updated to reflect the changes made. Technical SpecificationIn your final solution, you must include the following technical elements:
- Design and use of custom class to represent items in your library.
- Use of an appropriate STL container to store the items
- Use of at least one STL algorithm(Sort and Search).
- A usable text-based interface.In addition, marks will be awarded for students who go beyond the basic specification outlined above. Students are free to implement whatever you want.
